I created this tiny demo because the official feathers-vuex-chat doesn't work that well, and we need a quick demo to show how Feathers and vuex works. Here's the tracked issue: https://github.com/feathersjs-ecosystem/feathers-vuex/issues/252) 

Here's the original feathers-vuex-chat (that doesn't work for me): https://github.com/feathers-plus/feathers-chat-vuex

This quickly put-together demo builds off of https://github.com/lturel/Feathers4-Vue-FVuex2 who managed to create a feathers/vuex demo, to work with the feathers-chat server from the feathers tutorial: https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-chat

Pretty much all credit goes to @lturel, so thanks!
